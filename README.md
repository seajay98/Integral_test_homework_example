# Integral_test_homework_example
A write up of a Calculus II homework problem and solution with in-depth explanation.
This was written in 2022 when I was a graduate assistant at the Univeristy of Dayton and serving as a teachers assistant for some sections of Calculus II. I noticed that the students were struggling to understand the application of the integral test for bounding errors, and thought a formal written explanation could walk them through it more clearly. Several students thanked me for the explanation; I'm glad it helped the light bulb turn on!
